**Reenu_Boutique**

Boutique Management System is a software application design to add or manage customer 
information, keep their personal records, orders and delivery dates, etc.

**Problem definition**

This project allows fashion designers to manage their customer details. The details include 
contact information and measurements. This project would enable fashion designers to easily 
automate the management of customer measurements. It would make it easy for customers to 
select designs according to their type and budget. It asks admin to add in details about the 
customer. The details will be immediately view able once added to the program.

**SOFTWARE’S USED**

**HTML**

Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents 
designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading
Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the 
documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web
page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and 
other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML 
provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics. 

**JSP**

Architecturally, JSP may be viewed as a high-level abstraction of Java servlets. JSPs are 
translated into servlets at runtime, therefore JSP is a Servlet; each JSP servlet is cached and reused until the original JSP is modified.
Java Server Pages can be used independently or as the view component of a server-side model–
view–controller design, normally with JavaBeans as the model and Java servlets (or a framework 
such as Apache Struts) as the controller. This is a type of Model 2 architecture.
JSP allows Java code and certain predefined actions to be interleaved with static web markup 
content, such as HTML. The resulting page is compiled and executed on the server to deliver a 
document. The compiled pages, as well as any dependent Java libraries, contain Java byte code 
rather than machine code. Like any other .jar or Java program, code must be executed within 
a Java virtual machine (JVM) that interacts with the server's host operating system to provide an 
abstract, platform-neutral environment.
JSPs are usually used to deliver HTML and XML documents, but through the use of Output 
Stream, they can deliver other types of data as well.
The Web container creates JSP implicit objects like request, response, session, application, 
configuration, and page, page Context, out and exception. JSP Engine creates these objects 
during translation phase. 

**JAVA SCRIPT**

JavaScript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to 
the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multiparadigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
and first-class functions.
Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the Web. JavaScript 
enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority 
of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers have a 
dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, 
and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for 
working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object
Model (DOM). However, ECMAScript itself does not include any input/output (I/O), such 
as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, as the host environment (usually a web browser) 
provides those APIs.
JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in 
some servers, usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created 
with frameworks such as Electron and Cordova.
Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, 
and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.

**MY SQL**

SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language designed for 
querying data from a database. MySQL is a relational database management system, which is a 
completely different thing.

**ECLIPSE IDE**

Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) used in computer programming. It 
contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. It 
was one of the first IDEs to run under GNU Class path and it runs without problems under Iced 
Tea.

**TOMCAT**

Tomcat is an application server from the Apache Software Foundation that executes Java 
servlets and renders Web pages that include Java Server Page coding. Tomcat requires a Java 
Runtime Enterprise Environment that conforms to JRE 1.1 or later.
Software genre: Application server, Web server 
Developer: Apache Software Foundation
